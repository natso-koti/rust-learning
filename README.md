# Rust Learning Deliverables

This repo contains my milestone projects from *The Rust Programming Language* (Nichols & Klabnik).  
Each folder is a self-contained Cargo project.

## Milestones

1. **Getting Started** â€“ CLI greeting program  
2. **Common Concepts** â€“ Temperature converter & Fibonacci calculator  
3. **Ownership** â€“ Longest word function  
4. **Structs & Enums** â€“ Shape enum with area method  
5. **Collections** â€“ Word frequency counter  
6. **Error Handling** â€“ File line counter  
7. **Generics, Traits, Lifetimes** â€“ Largest element function & custom trait  
8. **Testing** â€“ Unit & integration tests  
9. **Minigrep** â€“ Extended text search project  
10. **Advanced Project** â€“ CLI task manager with JSON persistence

## How to Run
Each milestone is a separate Cargo project:

```bash
cd milestone-03-ownership
cargo run

---

## ðŸ”§ GitHub Workflow  

1. **One repo** called `rust-learning` (or similar).  
2. Each milestone = a subfolder with its own Cargo project (`cargo new milestone-xx-name`).  
3. Push progress often:  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Completed milestone 03: Ownership & References"
   git push origin main
```
